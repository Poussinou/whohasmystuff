# Privacy Policy for 'Who Has My Stuff'

This privacy policy was last modified on February 19th, 2017.

The Android app 'Who Has My Stuff' allows users to keep track of lent items.
In order to accomplish this, it requires two permissions:

* Read data of stored contacts (to select a specific person)
* Write to external storage (for backup purposes)

Since the app works offline completely, no data is transmitted at any time.
